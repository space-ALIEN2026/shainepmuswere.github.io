Hi, I'm **Shaine Muswere**, a **Cyber Security Analyst** based in **Rondebosch, Western Cape, South Africa**. I view myself as an innovator and an artist. I believe in the quote by the late Steve Jobs: *"Technology alone is not enoughâ€”it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing."*

I am a **SOC Level 2 Cyber Security Analyst** with experience in threat hunting, automation, and Python development. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, holding certifications such as **CompTIA CySA+**, **CompTIA Security+**, and others.

Feel free to reach out to me at [muswereshaine@gmail.com](mailto:muswereshaine@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaine-muswere-36b35ab3/).
